//! The NEUTRAL diagnostics VOCABULARY: the plane-agnostic types every diagnostic catalog is built
//! from — [`Class`] (the thousands digit), [`Severity`] (the log level), [`Diagnostic`] (one catalog
//! entry) and its zero-allocation [`Banner`] (`BUSBAR-NNNN`).
//!
//! This module holds only the VOCABULARY — the shared types a plane crate names to declare its own
//! `Diagnostic` consts against, WITHOUT reaching into the substrate. It names ZERO plane instance
//! and pulls no dependency beyond `std::fmt`, so it sits in the leaf contract every plane already
//! names. The neutral built-in catalog, the plane-install seam ([`install_diagnostics`]), the
//! runtime union ([`all`]/[`by_code`]) and the cross-crate emit macros stay in
//! `busbar-substrate-values`, which re-exports these types at their historical path
//! (`busbar_substrate::diagnostics::*`) so every existing caller keeps compiling unchanged.
