//! THE PARSE-TIME PLANE-BOUNDARY RULE for a hook reference, owned once.
//!
//! ## Why the whole rule lives here and not on a plane
//!
//! It was written twice — `a2a/config.rs` and `mcp/config.rs` each carried a
//! `refuse_cross_plane_reference` and a `validate_section_hooks`, and the two were byte-identical
//! down to the sentence an operator reads. Two of them included the same HARDCODED section list,
//! `["pools", "tools", "agents", "export", "identity-providers"]`, in two protocol-local files that
//! no compiler links. Nothing made them agree; they agreed because one was copied from the other.
//!
//! That list is the part that rots. It is a fact about the top-level config grammar, and the config
//! grammar is declared in two tables that already exist: [`Plane::ALL`] names the plane sections and
//! [`NamedMapSection::ALL`] names the 1.5.3 named-definition maps. A plane or a section added to
//! either table used to leave both copies of the literal behind, and a section missing from the
//! literal is not a loud failure — it is `agents.planner` being accepted as a bare hook name,
//! resolving to nothing, and an operator believing a control is attached that is not.
//!
//! So the list is DERIVED ([`config_sections`]) and passed in as a PARAMETER rather than written.
//! The judgement takes the sections it is judging against, which is also what lets a plane busbar
//! does not have be validated by this code with nothing written for it (see
//! `plane/tests/config_tests.rs`).
//!
//! **What core owns:** the trim, the empty-name refusal, the section-prefix scan, the bare-name
//! requirement, and every SENTENCE. **What a caller owns:** its own WORDING for WHERE the refusal
//! happened — `at` is "`agents.planner`" or "`tools.hooks`", and those are different sentences to an
//! operator diagnosing a boot failure. A caller keeps its refusal vocabulary, not its decision.
//!
//! The sentences survive the move through a TOTAL `From<Refusal<'_>> for String`. Totality is the
//! point: a refusal added to [`HookRefError`] later has to be given a sentence of its own rather
//! than being folded silently into a nearby arm, which is how two refusals become one wording that
//! is wrong for one of them.
//!
//! ## THIS IS NOT THE OTHER CROSS-PLANE REFUSAL, and the two must not be merged
//!
//! [`super::PlaneSections::resolve`] also refuses a cross-plane reference, with
//! [`super::RefError::CrossPlane`]. It is a SECOND, STRUCTURAL check and not a duplicate of this
//! one. They answer different questions at different moments:
//!
//!   * THIS one runs at PARSE time, on a STRING, before anything is known to exist. It refuses
//!     `agents.planner` written where a bare name belongs — a SHAPE that names a plane, whether or
//!     not any `planner` exists anywhere.
//!   * [`super::PlaneSections::resolve`] runs at RESOLVE time, on a name that EXISTS. It refuses a
//!     bare `planner` that resolves on a sibling plane — a name whose shape is legal and whose
//!     BINDING crosses the boundary.
//!
//! Neither subsumes the other: this one fires on a name nothing defines, and that one fires on a
//! name with no dot in it. Collapsing them would not deduplicate a check, it would delete one.
