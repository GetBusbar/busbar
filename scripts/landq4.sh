# BATCHED landing queue with a PRE-PROVE STAGE, and the reason it exists is arithmetic.
#
# The serial runner proves one batch on one box. `kind-isolation --selftest` is 1642 s on a fleet
# box and `construction --selftest` is another 400 s, and both run on EVERY landing by design — so
# a batch costs the better part of forty minutes whatever is in it, while seven boxes idle. A red
# batch then bisects SERIALLY, at the same price per half.
#
# THE PRE-PROVE STAGE SPENDS THE IDLE BOXES. Before the runner pops anything, the next up-to-six
# queue lines whose FILE SETS ARE DISJOINT are each handed to a box of their own and proven against
# the CURRENT TIP with `land.sh --batch --remote <host>` under `LAND_PREPROVE=1`: the box picks,
# proves, reports, and puts its tree back. Nothing is published and this tree never moves. The
# verdicts land in target/gate/preproved.txt, one row per line, WITH THE TIP THEY WERE PROVEN
# AGAINST.
#
# WHAT A PRE-PROOF IS AND IS NOT:
#
#   * It is not a landing, and NOTHING LANDS ON ONE. The serial runner still applies the picks and
#     runs the FULL proof over the union it popped. A green pre-proof changes the ORDER of the
#     queue, never its verdict — it says "this line was green on this tip an hour ago", which is a
#     good reason to try it first and no reason at all to skip proving it.
#   * A pre-proof is only evidence about the TIP IT WAS TAKEN ON. Every row carries that sha and is
#     ignored the moment the tip moves. A stale green is not a weaker green; it is not a green.
#   * A line pre-proven RED is parked `#RED-preproof` with the path to its log, at the head of the
#     queue, unchanged but for the marker — exactly as a red landing is parked. It is not deleted
#     and it is not skipped silently.
#   * A line with NO record is still poppable. The pre-prove stage is an accelerator, not a gate:
#     if the fleet is unreachable the queue runs exactly as it ran before, one batch at a time.
#
# WHY DISJOINT FILE SETS. Two lines that touch the same files are two lines whose proofs interact:
# proving each alone against the tip says nothing about the union, and the union is what the runner
# will actually pop. Disjointness (by `git diff --name-only` over each line's picks) is the cheap,
# checkable condition under which "each was green alone" is worth anything at all.
